> I liked the problem about the card game very much. I would never have thought that even I would be able to come up with a strategy with which I can always win. There I felt like I could find a solution to whatever problem.

> I really liked the casual attitude of the teacher, not demanding “university-like” seriousness (since he wasn’t this serious either.) I thought it was a good thing that he had helpers (although this also depends on what kind of helpers came.) I also liked the fact that I didn’t notice that the class was 3 hours long.

> What I liked the most was that the problems were interesting, creative and engaging. At last, there wasn’t a possibility for making mistakes by miscounting a long, complicated problem. Here, I had to think about a solution, not apply a pre-learned formula.
Thank you very much! I rarely have as good an experience with mathematics as I had during this event! It made my day!

> It was very good. I hope the education of mathematics will change in this direction!!!
