> I only have great memories of the camps… the interesting problems, exciting discussions, spectacular connections between seemingly unrelated things, wonderful company, cheerful environment, games, work and relaxation.
I acquired a vast array of knowledge which would not have been possible except much later with much more effort. Thanks to the camps, I have a more solid foundation for my future castle of academic knowledge.

One day I hope to be back in Tapolcsányi utca assisting the work of the camp leaders.
