> The carefully prepared, creative, thought-provoking, and at the same time exciting problems of the Pósa camps established problem-solving skills that I use regularly ever since, both in mathematics and in computer science. Lajos’s methodology and the enormous amount of care, through which every group and every participant gets introduced to problems at the right pace, develops individual thinking and problem-solving skills at levels that remain far beyond feasible using a traditional secondary school educational perspective.

The camps were always spent in good mood, and beside educational purposes, they also served as a community building and strengthening platform. I regard them as an essential memory of my high school years.
