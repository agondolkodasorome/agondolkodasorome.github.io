> Lajos Pósa put his math teaching method to test through us at Eötvös József Gimnázium. Starting with all topics from previously established foundations, we received a sequence of problems always having to take only one step of difficulty above the previously discussed ones. Given that most students were able to make these leaps, it was the problems themselves that taught us the topic.

He practically didn’t teach us anything. Naturally this is meant between quotation marks, not to be misunderstood. However, it was never him who pre-solved the problems for us at the board so that we may copy and learn to hate mathematics.

In completing his carefully put-together problems, it was us ourselves, who uncovered the mysteries of a given topic, we learned everything by ourselves.
He asked for the proof of all theorems within the curriculum, and most of them were always solved by some of us. The most beautiful proofs, apart from being rewarded with a good mark received the honour of providing the proof to be learned for test or the finals by the whole class.

Lajos Pósa, apart from being a brilliant math teacher is also a great person. On special, festive occasions he would read us from his favourite literary works during math class and taught us wonderful games. He really did give us the joy of thinking. I regard the four years spent with him as a life-defining experience.
