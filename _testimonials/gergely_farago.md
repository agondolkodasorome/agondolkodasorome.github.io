> For me, the most important message of the Posa-camps was that Lajos took the children very seriously with regard to mathematical problems or otherwise. This was also my parents’ attitude towards me which is probably why it had such a great impact, I even try to use it in other places ever since – it was of great use to me in my teaching and I try to raise my children in the same spirit as well.

A lot of problems and programs in the camps were discussed together. One of my favourites was the “What should we do?” conferences. Being able to meet my peers with whom I could talk about mathematics or other reasonable topics, or to play board games for that matter was a really novel experience indeed.
