> My way of thinking evolved immensely in the camp. I remember the games and problems to this very day. Lajos Pósa was always extremely kind and thoughtful with us. He always gave personal attention to all the children. To this day, I am proud to talk about my camp experiences, and I have a plethora of fond memories.
