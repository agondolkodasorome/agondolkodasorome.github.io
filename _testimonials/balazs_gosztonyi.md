> I had to privilege to have had, apart from the Pósa-camps, Péter Juhász lead extra-curricular courses at my school for 6 years which were very similar in spirit to the camps. The camps and the courses were both decisive experiences of my secondary school years, I always waited for them in excited anticipation. We were adventurers with ever new problems teasingly waiting for us to get a grip on them. The construction lasting several years, and the unexpected connections filled me with such beauty, I find mathematics akin to art. The long years of experiences spent together forged long-lasting friendships and acquaintances. Because of all these reasons if asked to introduce myself, I would be sure to add my Pósa-upbringing.

The camps and courses also endowed me with inspiration regarding the teaching of mathematics. In my view, it is far more important to get to like and develop a certain way of thinking than to learn specific methods when learning mathematics. The experiences from the camps fuel my belief that this is a feasible goal. It is possible to teach mathematics to most people – not only the gifted – in a way which is not the cause of constant nausea, but means the joy of thinking.
