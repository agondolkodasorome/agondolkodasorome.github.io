Mathematics has a thought provoking as well as a playful side. We believe that this is useful and pleasing to anybody and thus it is our goal to introduce as many students as possible to a beautiful and entertaining mathematics, the joy of independent thought.

It is our objective to seek out and find students who, although talented, did not have the opportunity to bring their abilities to fruition.

The program consists of two parts. During the spring semester of 2017 we sought out many school where, involving the interested students, we  tackled mathematics in an unconventional way. 

In the second part, starting autumn 2017 we organize a two year long, intense, talent developing series of programs for those students who we came in contact with.
