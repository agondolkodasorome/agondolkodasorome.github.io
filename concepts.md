The mathematical programs in our camps are unified by the teachers’ shared belief in a discovery-based education of mathematics.

The didactical foundations of our camps were laid by Lajos Pósa, one the most prominent proponents of the method. He introduced most teachers and all the assistants working in our camps to the mysteries of this teaching style and paradigm. Each of our weekend camps is led by one of his former students.

## What is the essence of this method?
The most important aim is to teach students how to think independently: we try to incite them to use their creativity and imagination, and to come up with their own ideas instead of just reciting formulas, methods or theorems.

The classes in our programs are not lectures, nor do we aim to teach knowledge beyond the regular curriculum. Our intention is to design classes where the students are not passive listeners but active participants, and they can even alter the course of the lesson. This means that the teacher adapts to the abilities and interests of the group on the fly. An interesting question from a student can easily become a new problem to solve. Besides individual work, thinking in pairs or small groups is also common in our sessions.

This simplistic overview should give a glimpse of our (much more complex) methodology. We believe it would be beneficial if this educational attitude were more widespread. This is why we are looking for ways to get involved in the training of young teachers, introducing them to the fundamentals and later the specifics of the method.
