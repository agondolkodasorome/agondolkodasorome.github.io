Between 1972 and 1982, I was a research mathematician at the Institute of Mathematics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, I finished my doctorate degree in 1977. I did not find it satisfying because I am most interested in theoretical and practical problems in dialogical thinking. This is why I started teaching in 1977, and I taught mathematics from 1982 to 2013 at Fazekas Mihály Gimnázium. Currently I am giving extracurricular classes and am leading a seminar on mathematics, art and uniform evaluation at the Eötvös Loránd University.
