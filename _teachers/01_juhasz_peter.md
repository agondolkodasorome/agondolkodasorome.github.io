I am a math teacher, cartographer, computer scientist, a senior research fellow at the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics. I have a PhD on map projections from the Eötvös Loránd University. I was a member of Lajos Pósa's first weekend camp group, TO, as a student, and then participated in many other camps as a helper. I had previously been camp leader for groups Rozsomák, S and Okapi. Currently I am leading group Zooey.
