I taught for the special math program at Fazekas Mihály Gimnázium from 1972 to 2015, and have been a lecturer at the Orthodox Jewish school in Wesselényi Street. I spent much of my long tenure with developing talent, and I also held extracurricular classes in Fazekas for external students. Since 2017, I often helped with Flying School sessions. It is important to me that talented students see the appropriate problems to develop their skills, and that they enjoy doing mathematics.
