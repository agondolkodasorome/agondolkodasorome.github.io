I graduated from the Eötvös Loránd University as a math teacher. I first experienced the Pósa method during my high school years at the Eötvös József Gimnázium, as a student of Lajos Pósa. I have been an avid supporter of Pósa type joy mathematics. Every member of my family learned from Pósa: our daughters participated in the weekend camps. As a foundation employee, I lead the monthly Mini Camps for sixth graders.
