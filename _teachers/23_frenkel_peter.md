I graduated from the Eötvös Loránd University in 2002, and obtained my PhD from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in 2008. As a mathematician, I teach algebra in the math institute of ELTE. I have taught in MaMuT2 since 2013. I have previously participated in organizing and teaching at math camps for talented students since 1998. In my free time I enjoy playing the piano and hiking.
