  <p>I am not only the leader of Prospero, but also the parent of fortunate, talented children. I feel we cannot accept it that only few (say, middle-class) children can be offered a chance. With our support, and also with my personal voluntary work I wish to help giving a chance to develop for less fortunate children as well.</p>
