  <p>My way of thinking evolved immensely in the camp. I remember the games and problems to this very day. Lajos PÃ³sa was always extremely kind and thoughtful with us. He always gave personal attention to all the children. To this day, I am proud to talk about my camp experiences, and I have a plethora of fond memories.</p>
