<p>My background is in humanities, and I direct a book company. Within the Foundation, I am the head organizer of the Gondola project working with disadvantaged students. I met Lajos PÃ³sa and the Foundation through my children. It is no wonder that I like books, but I am also enthusiastic about baroque music and playing tennis.</p>
