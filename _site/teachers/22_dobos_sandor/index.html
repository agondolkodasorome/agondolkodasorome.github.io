<p>I have been teaching at Fazekas since 1992, and was a young teacher when I was first invited to the summer camps leading to MaMuT. I was very enthusiastic and completely inexperienced when I started. I was surrounded by a great environment, for which I am grateful to my colleagues and students. Math people can also recognize me as a trainer of Hungarian IMO team, or from my ocarina music during math sessions.</p>
