<p>I have a mathematician and a math teacher degree from the Eötvös Loránd University, and and economist degree from the Budapest Business School. After finishing my PhD at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, I spent a few years as a researcher at SZTAKI and at BUTE. I have been with Morgan Stanley since 2006. I was a member of Lajos Pósa’s first weekend camp group, TO, as a student, and then participated in many other camps as a helper. I co-led the weekend camps of groups ZsA and ZsB with Lajos Pósa, and I have taught ninth graders at MaMuT for years.</p>
